# MIPS32 Simulator
# How it works?
Our MIPS32 Simulator when run, displays a graphical user interface to upload an assembly file present anywhere in your computer and executes it. It displays the values stored in the registers and in the data segment after the execution of the file on a GUI. Also it displays the values of the registers after executing each step on the console.
